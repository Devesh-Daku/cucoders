      "The person in the picture you see is me, yes me I'm Faria and here I'm to help you with your studies in your creative areas, I'm a Graphic designer, let me explain you all the term 'Graphic design', Graphic design is the process of visual communication through your art and your creative mind and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography, iconography and illustration, well I would love to give you all an in-depth knowledge of all the terms I had used here and that's what I'm here for. This field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term 'graphic design' is used synonymously and the person who performs this art is called a Graphic designer, you can also be one. I hope a small brief about my professional life is good to understand, 'What basically I can help you with'.",
      "In my area I carry four years of experience professionally and I also carry an experience in teaching as well. Therefore, that wasn't all I do. Recently I started my own food blog on Instagram called, foodybegum. My motive to create that page was to give a sense of food, places , flavours and cooking but the time I began it was a lockdown and a pandemic crisis occurred all over so stepping out and traveling places went on hold. Moreover, I thought it out in a different way and then I began with my own cooking recipes and again when it comes to cooking; Us the new cooks and learners happen to give up thinking cooking is really a tough job but that's not it. I tend to be here today to tell you that we can cook in the most simplified manner along with an amazing taste and a good presentation too.",
      "I hope spreading the knowledge of what I know will be the best thing I could do.",
